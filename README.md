Terminal user interface for `journalctl` (tool from [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd)), written in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) with the [gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) library.

Displays a list of all available system and user logs for quick viewing and filtering with regex support (like grep).

This tool is inspired by and with 🧡 love for [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) and [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).
